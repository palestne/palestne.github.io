# Chapter 1: Solving the cash problem 

## Foreword

Let's take a look at step one, which involves getting the kingdom started for one. And that requires 40 slayer, which is best achieved through magic. Magic also unlocks teleportation, which'll come in handy moving around the map. All that requires GP. The best way to do that quickly is the wilderness agility course.

______

After spawning in Lumbridge do the following:
- [ ] Get 5 thieving 
- [ ] Get 52 agility 

Initial agility will get us moving around (and obivously for the wildnerss course), and 5 thieving will come in handy for getting cakes as food for the course. Now we need an initial cash stack to fund the 150k entrance fee. As such we'll need to do some Wintertodt. 

- [ ] Do Stronghold of Security for 10k
- [ ] Grab clue hunter boots/gloves, boots of lightness 
- [ ] Do Daddy's Home 
- [ ] Grab a fire staff
- [ ] Do Children of the Sun 
- [ ] Get 50 FM 
- [ ] Trek to Wintertodt and grab clue hunter garb on the way

While we're here for FM to an extent (we'll want 75 FM for quest cape) we are more interested in the rewards. 

- [ ] Solo Wintertodt till 75 FM

This should give us enough funds to cover the 150k entrance fees at the wilderness course. 

⚠️ **Caution:** the next piece is extremely difficult! Here are some tips:

  - Do not under any circumstances use mass worlds. Dark bow rushers will pop you immediately
  - It is highly recommended you use an alt and position it [here]() so that when you're at the stepping stones you can have vision on the starting area. 
  - If you see someone log outside the course in nothing immediately get to a safe spot and hop (climbing down ladder and getting behind is generally safe). It is a pker scouting the course and trying to confuse you, while bringing their main account in position from another world, then eventually hopping on yours beside you to pop you
  - Even if a pker can't attack go down the ladder and get in the safe position, while your scout keeps an eye on what they're doing. Stay hidden for 2-3 minutes, if they have another account they'll have logged in by then and your scout will catch them, and if not you don't need to necessarily hop as we do like to maintain the streak

It is extremely important that you make your first trip count. You'll likely have ~250k from Wintertodt, so if you don't come back with some loot to sell you're in for a rough time. I'll let you figure out where to sell the loot. If you do wipe and need to make another 50k for another entrance fee there are methods to make some 'quick' cash (ie steel plate body spawn in wilderness). Do not depend on these, make your first trip count!

  
- [ ] Do wilderness course till 77 agility, particularly 1.5m exp

We'll eventually want 80 agility for the Cerb shortcut, so 77 plus quest rewards will get us 80 down the line.

With more money than we know what to do with we have completed chapter 1, and head to setting up our core dailies.
