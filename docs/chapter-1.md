# Chapter 1: Solving the cash problem 

## Foreword

Given the early game focuses on getting the kingdom started for one, we need to do slayer to 40. Which is best achieved through magic early on. Magic also unlocks teleportation, which'll come in handy moving around the map. All that requires GP. The best way to do that quickly is the wilderness agility course.

______

After spawning in Lumbridge do the following:
- [ ] Get 5 thieving 
- [ ] Get 52 agility (recommend Brimhaven 40 - 52)

Initial agility will get us moving around (and obviously for the wilderness course), and 5 thieving will come in handy for getting cakes as food for the course. Now we need an initial cash stack to fund the 150k entrance fee. As such we'll need to do some Wintertodt. 

- [ ] Stronghold of Security for 10k
- [ ] Grab 3 pieces of warm clothing
- [ ] Daddy's Home (for some initial construction levels, helpful for getting more exp at Wintertodt)
- [ ] Children of the Sun (to grab mithril, addy axe)
- [ ] Get 50 FM 
- [ ] Trek to Wintertodt and grab clue hunter garb on the way

While we're here for FM to an extent (we'll want 75 FM for quest cape) we are more interested in the rewards. 

- [ ] Solo Wintertodt till 75 FM

This should give us enough funds to cover the 150k entrance fees at the wilderness course. 

⚠️ **Caution:** the next piece is extremely difficult! Here are some tips:

  - Allocate at least an hour for your session. If you have to log out soon there's no point in starting up a session, as you'll set yourself back 10 laps when you log out
  - Do not under any circumstances use mass worlds. Dark bow rushers will pop you immediately
  - It is highly recommended you use an alt and position it here ![alt text](/assets/images/image.png) so that when you're at the stepping stones you can have vision on the starting area. 
  - If you see someone log outside the course in nothing immediately get to a safe spot and hop (climbing down ladder and getting behind is generally safe). It is a pker scouting the course and trying to confuse you, while bringing their main account in position from another world, then eventually hopping on yours beside you to pop you
  - Even if a pker can't attack go down the ladder and get in the safe position, while your scout keeps an eye on what they're doing. Stay hidden for 2-3 minutes, if they have another account they'll have logged in by then and your scout will catch them, and if not you don't need to necessarily hop as we do like to maintain the streak
  - Redeem [tickets at 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1nj1fvh/it_makes_little_sense_redeeming_wilderness/) everytime
  - Even if you die remember - you may have lost the gold, but you they can't take the EXP away from you. Don't despair, try again!

It is extremely important that you make your first trip count. You'll likely have ~250k from Wintertodt, so if you don't come back with some loot to sell you're in for a rough time. I'll let you figure out where to sell the loot. If you do wipe and need to make another 50k for another entrance fee there are methods to make some 'quick' cash (ie steel plate body spawn in wilderness). Do not depend on these, make your first trip count!

  
- [ ] Wilderness course till 76 agility, particularly 1.45m exp

We'll eventually want 80 agility for the Cerb shortcut, so 76 plus quest rewards will get us 80 down the line.

With more money than we know what to do with we have completed chapter 1, and head to setting up our [transportation network](chapter-2.html).
