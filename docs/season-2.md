# Season II: Mid Game

With dailies unlocked, decent QP and combat stats somewhere around the middle we'll start the next journey of account progression - mid game. Mid game will involve a little bit of PvM to get decent gear for an extended afk melee training grind, so void, strength ammy, berserk ring will be the goal. TODO
