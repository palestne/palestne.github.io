# Chapter IV - Unlocking Dailies

## Foreword

We can get exp and resources passively while we do something completely else - you can be doing some slayer training while your kingdom generates logs, your farm patches generate herbs/exp, and certain NPCs generate other useful items (ie buckets of sand, staves). So let's priortize unlocking these passive benefits early.  


______ 

The only thing between the Kingdom now is slayer training. And some more questing can be done to get some chunks of slayer exp:

- [ ] Animal Magnetism
- [ ] A Porcine of Interest
- [ ] Wanted!

The rest will have to be through Vanaka (we're not interested in Tureal boosting just yet, our foremost priority is unlocking the kingdom ASAP)

- [ ] Train to 40 slayer




TODOTODO
- [ ] Enter the Abyss (will come in handy for Varrock Easy down the line)
