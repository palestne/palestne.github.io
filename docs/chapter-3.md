## Foreword

As we continue our push to unlocking dailies there are still significant amount of quests yet to do. And these quests are best done with overheads. Overheads are fundemental in RS, so we prioritize unlocking them and then with them doing the phase 2 quests that will eventually unlock the dailies.
