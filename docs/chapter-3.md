# Chapter III - Phase 2 Quests & Prayers

## Foreword

As we continue our push to unlocking dailies there are still a significant amount of quests yet to do. And these quests are best done with overheads. Overheads are fundemental in RS so we prioritize unlocking them, and with them doing the phase 2 quests that will eventually unlock the dailies.

Typically prayer training involves dragon boots and so that's what we'll do. To kill them effectively an Iban Staff is handy, which will also be useful for slayer training down the road. To do so we need to do some range training, Underground Pass and attack training:

- [ ] Do Goblin Diplomacy 
- [ ] Do Death to the Dorgeshun
- [ ] Train range to 25
- [ ] Do Underground Pass
- [ ] Do Fremenik Trials
- [ ] Train to 50 attack on sand crabs


Now it's time to skin some blue drags, and with 76 agility the Taverly dungeon is super accessible:

- [ ] Grab ~100 d bones from blue drags
- [ ] Train prayer to 43 with wildy chaos altar

With 43 prayer we've unlocked some more quests we can do safely, and at this point it is a massive q u e s t i n g  m a r a t h o n.
