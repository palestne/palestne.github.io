# Chapter III - Phase 2 Quests & Prayers

## Foreword

As we continue our push to unlocking dailies there are still a significant amount of quests yet to do. And these quests are best done with overheads. Overheads are fundemental in RS, so let's unlock them and use them to do the phase 2 quests (ie Hero's requirements).

______

Typically prayer training involves dragon bones so that's what we'll do. You can either kill green drags, but we're pretty sick of the wilderness so killing blue dragons at Taverly with the shortcut (given we're 76 agility) and a falador TP is pretty comfy. To kill either effectively an Iban Staff is handy, which will also be useful for slayer training down the road. 

To wield Iban Staff we need Underground Pass, which will involve some range training, and 50 attack:

- [ ] Goblin Diplomacy 
- [ ] Lost Tribe
- [ ] Death to the Dorgeshun
- [ ] Giant Dwarf
- [ ] Train range to 25
- [ ] Biohazard
- [ ] Underground Pass
- [ ] Fremenik Trials (craft dramen staff, use pvp world to use manta rays as food)
- [ ] Train to 50 attack on sand crabs
- [ ] Ethically Acquired Antiquities 


We can now go kill some green/blue drags, but before we do that we might as well unlock ToG. We should have 36 thieving by now, so we can steal the Bullseye Lantern:

- [ ] Tears of Guthix
- [ ] Grab ~100 d bones
- [ ] Train prayer to 43 with wildy chaos altar

Congrats, first 'daily' unlocked! I was at a little over [4 days played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaRDhXwVr3k) at this point, but if you did Brimhaven agility you'll be even faster. Give yourself a pat on the back, ToG under 4 days is something. 

Moving on - with 43 prayer we've unlocked some more quests we can do safely, and at this point it is a massive q u e s t i n g  m a r a t h o n, because of Hero's Quest. The below quests give an assortment of exp in skills Hero's needs, along with them being the hard reqs:

- [ ] Shield of Arrav
- [ ] Dragon Slayer
- [ ] Black Knight Fortress
- [ ] Recruitment Drive
- [ ] Druidic Ritual
- [ ] Merlin's Crystal
- [ ] Big Chompy Bird Hunting -> Zogre
- [ ] Jungle Potion
- [ ] Shilo Village (we'll need to do some fishing here)
- [ ] Digsite
- [ ] Another Slice of Ham
- [ ] Shades of Morton 


At this point you should have all the prereqs done and only need to grind out some training for cooking, fishing and mining. Feel free to deviate a little - check the wiki and see if there's any extra quests you can do that would award cooking, fishing or mining exp. There may be something that doesn't require too much of a distraction, but if the rabbit hole is too big just train the old fashioned way.

- [ ] Train fishing to 53 at Shilo Village
- [ ] Train cooking to 53 at rogue's den
- [ ] Train mining to 50 at desert sandstone mine
- [ ] Finally do Hero's Quest!

We are now very close to the kingdom, so [let's get to unlocking it!](chapter-4.html)
