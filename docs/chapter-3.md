# Chapter III - Phase 2 Quests & Prayers

## Foreword

As we continue our push to unlocking dailies there are still a significant amount of quests yet to do. And these quests are best done with overheads. Overheads are fundemental in RS, so let's unlock them and use them to do the phase 2 quests (ie Hero's requirements).

Typically prayer training involves dragon bones so that's what we'll do. You can either kill green drags, but we're pretty sick of the wilderness so killing blue dragons at Taverly with the shortcut (given we're 76 agility) and a falador TP makes for quick banking. To kill them effectively an Iban Staff is handy, which will also be useful for slayer training down the road. 

To wield Iban Staff we need Underground Pass and 50 attack, which will involve some range training:

- [ ] Do Goblin Diplomacy 
- [ ] Do Death to the Dorgeshun
- [ ] Train range to 25
- [ ] Do Underground Pass
- [ ] Do Fremenik Trials
- [ ] Train to 50 attack on sand crabs


Now it's time to skin some blue drags, and with 76 agility the Taverly dungeon is super accessible:

- [ ] Grab ~100 d bones from blue drags
- [ ] Train prayer to 43 with wildy chaos altar

With 43 prayer we've unlocked some more quests we can do safely, and at this point it is a massive q u e s t i n g  m a r a t h o n.
