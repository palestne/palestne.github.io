# Chapter II: The Transportation Network

## Foreword

RuneScape is massive, and the ideal way to traverse the map is through teleports. Teleports come in many ways - through quests, magic, jewelry and so on.  Given quests has us run around the map it's therefore desirable to unlock teleports first to get into serious questing. However some questing needs to be done anyway to actually unlock teleports (ie fairy rings) so we're going to break the early quests into a phase one, phase two approach, with phase one being for the teleportation network. 

Typically the way we want to handle early questing is check the skill requirements for that quest, see if we have it, if we don't check for other quest that award exp in that skill. So for example - we need to do Fairytale II which needs crafting, so elemental workshop is a good idea, but elemental workshop requires smithing, so Knights Sword can be a good idea, but Knight's Sword requires mining...so do Doric's Quest!

**BUT don't get too sucked up in this.** Our real goal is unlocking the kingdom ASAP, so going down these rabbit holes can be cute, but remain focused. If it takes 5 minutes to just get a skill up regularly...just get the skill up. 

______

We'll first buy some runes and get some early magic levels:

- [ ] Do Witch's Potion
- [ ] Do Imp Catcher
- [ ] Train magic to 51 
  - you can either afk fire strike, or splash curse if you want it faster

We'll then want to push for Fairytale II for fairy ring teleports, which needs crafting and smithing. We also want to push for easy Ardy diary for the monastary teleport, and Tree Gnome Village to unlock the spirit trees. As stated in the beginning the scribbles won't micromanage on how we do these, but ultimately we need to do:

- [ ] Chef's Quest
- [ ] Misthalin Mystery 
- [ ] Sheep Shearer
- [ ] Sleeping Giants
- [ ] Doric's Quest
- [ ] Knight's Sword
- [ ] Fishing Contest
- [ ] RfD: Dwarf

A note on RfD: Dwarf - an early rock cake can come in super handy for suiciding and restoring run energy. Rather than use the clan teleport and blocking the minigame teleport, we can use the rock cake to restore our run energy. Try it out, it works great! Anyway, we continue:

- [ ] Murder Mystery
- [ ] Plague City 
- [ ] Sea Slug
- [ ] Easy Ardougne Diary
- [ ] Tree Gnome Village
- [ ] Fight Arena
- [ ] Grand Tree
- [ ] Waterfall Quest
- [ ] Elemental Workshop I/II
- [ ] Observatory Quest
- [ ] Lost City

These are roughly in order of region, and allowing for just enough skill levels for Fairy Tale II (flinch Tangleroot). The fishing quests (Fishing Contest, Sea Slug) are needed if you get the eel as an item in Fairy Tale I, but you will still need to top up fishing in Catherby or your preferred location.

With the transportation foundation set up, let's look at [completing the phase 2 quests and grabbing overheads](chapter-3.html).
