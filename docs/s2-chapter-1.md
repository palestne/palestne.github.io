# Chapter V - Dipping toes into PvM

## Foreword

Our home will be fossil island for some time, as we'll need to continously to seaweed runs, birdhouse runs while mixing in some farm runs/ToG, kingdom upkeep here and there. Rather than sit idly at fossil island let's do some melee training. But in order to do melee training we need to unlock some gear so that we can get competitive exp rates.
