# About

The goal of these scribbles/[series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1prbbf0Qvw&list=PLyybZ9tEDYq_LVr_I5ZkKAz1BVmZNaJE0) is to reach high level PvM fairly quickly on a fresh iron account. Maxing will **NOT** be the goal - aside from a select few non combat skills (ie construction for house + bank tp) most will be left at just the level required to do a certain quest/diary requirement (ie FM at 75). These scribbles/'guide' are also unapologetically 'inefficient' - they employ heavy afk/comfy methods of training in order to be accessible to most, while still aiming to 'rush' into PvMing. 

In order to PvM effectively we want to focus on the following:

1. Setting up core dailies (kingdom, farm/birdhouse/seaweed/staves runs, tears of guthx), to help upkeep herbs, construction/crafting supplies, etc
2. Max combat skills, to remove stat check from PvM
3. 85 construction, to set up resetting and teleportation logistics 
4. Questing + slayer, to unlock key boseses for gear upgrades and slayer tasks
5. Hard diaries + elite Lumbridge/Kourend, to optimize slayer block list and teleports to bosses ie rada 4 to hydra

The above list is relatively in sequence, and the contents will be divded into seasons and chapters. 

The contents will be written with some intentional ambiguity, and rather than labelling them as steps they will instead be referred to as *pieces*. Compared to other guides that lay out, well steps in their case, in an extremely micromanaged fashion, these scribbles will lay out the pieces so that the user can bring in their own creativity. RuneScape is about charting your own journey, setting your own progression, solving puzzles, and frankly *growth*. This is the intention of laying the contents here as pieces instead of steps, so you express your own creativity. There are also explanations given on why we are doing these pieces. 

To use an analogy from other RPGs - the pieces are waypoints that still allow you to take a detour to explore that cave. Anyway let's get to it - onto [Season I](docs/season-1.html).
